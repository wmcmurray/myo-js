myo-js
======

An API for using Myo armband on the web. The Myo Connect application have to be running on user's computer for this to work.


Project's state
======
It's currently in an early stage so the API may change in the next weeks. I suggest you don't use my code right now but you can take a look at it for sure. :)

Available demos
======
- **Sandbox** : display a list of connected devices with all their datas + vibration buttons
- **Website navigator** : enable users to scroll in a website with the myo

Todo
======
- [ ] Use Y velocity with spread fingers pose instead of wave in/out in the website navigator
- [ ] Create a demo with a 3D device rotating at the center with orientation datas
- [ ] Integrates the web navigator into chrome & firefox extensions to enable myo support on all websites of the entire world !
