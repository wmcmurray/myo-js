An API for using the Myo armband on the web.

**The Myo Connect application must be running** on user's computer for this to work.

Project's state
======
It's currently in an early stage so the API may change in the next weeks. I suggest you don't use my code right now but you can take a look at it for sure. :)

Todo
======
- [ ] Use Y velocity with spread fingers pose instead of wave in/out in the website navigator
- [ ] Save last "locked" state of website plugin in a cookie to keep the same state between pages
- [ ] Handle bluetooth strength data
- [ ] Create a demo with a 3D device rotating at the center with orientation datas
- [ ] Integrates all of this into nodejs ? maybe ?
- [ ] Integrates the web navigator into chrome & firefox extensions to enable myo support on all websites of the entire world !
